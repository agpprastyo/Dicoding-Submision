Then cut the circle out. Place in the springform pan and butter the pan. Add 1 T flour and tap out any excess.</li><li>Melt the chocolate and butter in a heatproof glass bowl, as well as the 8 T of sugar, if using unsweetened sugar as I did in a double boiler. Reserve the 1/3 cup of sugar until later. Set aside chocolate and butter mixture to cool slightly, about 5 minutes.</li><li>In a separate small bowl, combine the 4 egg yolks, dissolved coffee and vanilla extract and whisk until just blended. Combine this yolk mixture with the chocolate mixture whisk until well blended.</li><li>In a very clean, large glass bowl beat the 4 egg whites on medium-high and add the cream of tartar or lemon juice and beat until soft peaks form. This should take about 3 minutes. Beat another minute while slowly adding the 1/3 cup of granulated sugar. Then beat 1 more minute. The whites should be stiff. Using a rubber spatula, gently fold the egg whites into the chocolate mixture in 3 different batches until no white streaks remain.</li><li>Pour the cake batter into the prepared springform pan and smooth the top. Bake in the oven on a center rack for about 20 minutes. The cake is done when a knife inserted comes out clean. Transfer to a wire rack and let cool for at least 1 hour. Run a knife along the edge of the pan to loosen the cake and then release the sides of the springform pan and lift off. Use a spatula to separate the cake from the bottom and lift off the parchment paper.</li><li>In a clean glass bowl, whip the whipping cream until it starts to form peaks and add the chai and powdered sugar. Continue to whip until soft peaks form. Do not over whip or it will turn into butter.</li><li>Serve with a dollop of chai-spiced whipped cream.</li></ol>",

Reduce the speed to low and gradually add the powdered sugar. Once all of the powdered sugar is incorporated, increase the speed to medium-high and add the vanilla, mix well. Whip at medium-high speed until light and fluffy, about 2 minutes, scraping the bowl as needed.

Place meat in roasting pan, and coast with sugar (you want kind of a thin crust). Season generously with salt and pepper and cover with onions. Tent pan with aluminum foil.\nRoast meat for 3 to 4-1/2 hours, or until beef is fork tender and can be pulled apart easily. Remove from oven, and set aside to cool slightly. Meanwhile, chop bacon into small-dice bits.\nWhen meat can be handled, shred apart and add barbecue sauce and bacon. Mix until evenly coated and bacon is distributed. Season with salt and pepper to taste, and add more barbecue sauce if you will. Serve hot on toasted buns or Hawaiian rolls.",

Pour 250 ml boiling water over it and leave it to soak for at least 15 minutes.</p><p>3. In a large pot, saute the chopped bell pepper, onion, and mushrooms over medium heat.</p><p>4. Meanwhile, fry the beef in a hot skillet until crispy.</p><p>5. While the beef is frying, blend the chili peppers you've been soaking with the soaking liquid.</p><p>6. Add the beef to the large pot filled with the sauteed vegetables.</p><p>7. Add the tomato sauce and blended chili peppers to the pot. If it is not enough liquid, add beef or vegetable broth (the other 250 ml water and 5 grams bouillon powder, unless you have \"real\" broth on hand) until everything is covered.</p><p>8. Season with salt, pepper, cumin, and oregano to taste.</p><p>9. Simmer for about 45 minutes or until thick enough. Serve with fresh cilantro.</p>",

Slowly beat in the soft butter, then beat for a further few minutes. A few small lumps of butter will remain, this is okay. Gently fold in the almond meal, rice flour, baking powder and lemon zest. Spoon the mixture into the cake tin. Dot the rhubarb pieces on top, gently pushing them down into the batter a little. Bake for 35-40 minutes until a skewer pushed into the centre of the cake comes out clean and the rhubarb is tender.\nCool in the tin before serving dusted with icing sugar and softly whipped cream on the side.

Re-cover and return to the oven for 45 minutes.</li><li>After the 45 minutes, add the cabbage to the pan, re-cover and return to the oven for fifteen minutes.</li><li>During the final braising of the ribs and vegetables, prepare the glaze.</li><li>Combine the sugar, beer and vinegar in a small saucepan and heat to a boil over medium heat.</li><li>Cook at a low boil for 5 minutes, stirring often.</li><li>Remove the glaze from the heat, add the mustard and stir to combine.</li><li>Set aside until ribs and vegetables are finished braising.</li><li>Remove the vegetables and ribs from the oven when the cooking time is complete (about 2 hours).</li><li>Remove the ribs and place on a baking rack set over a pan. Re-cover the vegetables to keep them warm while you glaze the ribs.</li><li>Brush a light coat of glaze on the underside of the ribs and a thicker layer on the top side.  Use about 1/2 the glaze.</li><li>Place the ribs into the oven and cook for 15 minutes.  This will give you a good base layer of glaze.</li><li>After 15 minutes, remove the ribs for a final coating and turn the oven up to 425</li><li>Brush the rest of the glaze on the ribs, return to the oven and cook for 10 to 15 minutes more, until the glaze is lightly browned and bubbly but not burned.</li><li>When the glazed ribs are done, allow to cook for a couple of minutes (that sugar will be hot!).</li><li>Remove the vegetables from the braising liquid and serve with the ribs on a platter to serve and cut at the table or cut the meat into rib sections. If you wish to forego the vegetables,  by the way, the ribs make a fantastic appetizer all on their own.</li></ol>",

Turn it off and let cool completely.\nStrain out the mint leaves and lavender and pour the cooled syrup into an ice cube tray - should make roughly 4 syrup cubes. Place the tray in the freezer until syrup is frozen (the cubes may remain a little mushy as a result of all the sugar.)\nOnce the berries and herb-infused syrup cubes have frozen, you can make the sorbet. Place the frozen berries and syrup cubes in the bowl of a cuisinart or blender and add a few teaspoons of ice water to aid in blending. Continue to process or blend, adding small amounts of the ice water as needed, until smooth.\nServe, topped with a sprig of mint leaves and/or lavender.",

Mix on low speed, until the cream cheese is completely smooth. BTW, I use Philadelphia Cream Cheese as I find it the smoothest.</li><li>Add the eggs, one at a time, mixing them in completely after each addition.</li><li>Pour one third of the cream cheese mixture into the prepared pan. Add a third of the browinies, then pour in another third of the cream cheese mixture. Repeat with anothe third of the brownies, then pour on the remianign cream cheese mixture. Stick the rest of the brownies into the top of the cheesckae, pushing them down into the mixture slightly.</li><li>Place the preapred and filled pan in a larger pan, then pour in enough hot water to come up to half of the pan's height.</li><li>Bake at 325 degrees for about 1 1/4 to 1/2 hours, or until it is mostly set. Turn of the oven, then leave the cheesecake in the oven,placing  a large wooden spoon in the oven door, so that it remains slightly open. Allow the cheeecake to cool in the open oven for about an hour, then cool completley on a rack. When it's cool, wrap it very well, and cool in the refrigerator for several hours.</li><li>To unmold the cake, wipe the sides and bottom of the pan with a hot, damp towel. Run a thin metal spatula around the edge of the pan. Release the spring, then lift the cake still on the on the removable bottom from the sides of the pan. Flip the cake gently onto a cardboard round or flat platter, remove the bottom, then flip it over onto another cardboard round or flat serving platter.</li></ol>",

      "instructions": "<ol><li>Pulse the almond flour and powdered sugar until blended, then sift twice to make sure all larger pieces of almond are separated out and the flour is blended well.</li><li>Add the lemon zest and lavender to the flour and set aside.</li><li>Pulse the white sugar in processor until very fine.</li><li>In the large bowl of a standing mixer or by hand, start whipping egg whites until foamy.</li><li>Add a pinch of cream of tartar, and whip until soft peaks form.</li><li>Reduce speed to low, and add the fine white sugar one tablespoon at a time.  When fully incorporated, increase speed to medium and then to high, and whip until stiff-peaked.  Timing varies on this, and this is where practice makes perfect.  Add your food coloring gel when almost completely done whipping.</li><li>Sift 1/3 of the flour into the egg and fold in completely.  Repeat until all the flour is incorporated.  You want to fold in until the batter is smooth, but still light.</li><li>Spoon into pastry bag fitted with a large tip (I use between 1/2 and 1 inch, depending on what I grab first).  Pipe 1 inch rounds onto parchment lined baking sheets, pulling the tip to the side so as to not leave a peak mark.  I use very thick sheets for this recipe.  Double up if needed.</li><li>Tap the pan somewhat assertively on the counter to remove any trapped air and help batter to settle.</li><li>Let sit for 1/2  2 hours, until a shell forms on the top and your finger pressed lightly doesnt leave a mark.</li><li>Now, bakers are completely split on the right temperature for baking macarons.  Some bake slowly at 270-350 degrees.  I tried to keep my temperamental oven at around 300 for these, holding the door slightly ajar with a spoon.  This way I can keep them in longer to assure that the insides are cooked without browning them on top, which happened with a batch that was drier / baked higher.</li><li>Bake in fully preheated oven for 5 minutes, turn the pan, and bake for around 8 minutes more, or until the feet of the macaron are a bit sturdier than soft.</li><li>Cool on sheets for two minutes, then remove to rack to cool completely.</li><li>Fill with prepared lemon curd and refrigerate to harden. </li><li>Serve at room temperature with tea.  Preferably wearing a skirt.  Or at least barefoot.</li></ol>",

If you try this without an ice cream maker the consistency will not be as creamy as youd get when using an ice cream maker, but the ice cream will still be great!\nIf you have leftovers in the freezer, thaw the ice cream at least 10 minutes before attempting to dig in because it will be much stiffer than store-bought ice cream.",

If the dough looks like pebbles, it's a touch too dry. Add about 1/2-1 tsp of water and mix again. It should form a nice ball of dough. Once your dough is mixed, bring it out of the processor and knead it for a few minutes.</li><li>Cover your ball of pasta dough with plastic wrap and let it rest for a good twenty minutes.</li><li>While your dough is resting, let's whip up the tasty filling.

Let the zucchini sit for 15 minutes while the salt extracts the moisture. Drain excess water, squeezing zucchini, if necessary.\nMeanwhile, cook bacon in a skillet over medium heat until crisp, turning frequently. Remove bacon to a stack of paper towels to drain. Crumble bacon. Remove all but 2 T of bacon drippings from the pan.\nReturn the pan to medium heat. Add the green onions and broccoli, stirring frequently for about 3-5 minutes or until crisp-tender. Add zucchini and 2 T of pesto, tossing to combine all ingredients. Taste and add more pesto, if needed. The mixture only needs to warm up, so 2-3 minutes of cooking ought to do it.\nServe with bacon crumbles and freshly grated Parmesan cheese.",
